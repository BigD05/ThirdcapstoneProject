# ThirdcapstoneProject
this project makes use of loops and conditional statements and what we do is make a taskmanager how we start it is by iterating through a user.text file and read the 
user name and password and create a way to add a user name and password to the file so when a user logs on they can do so with they own password and username then depending 
on what you logged on us if its a normal user you get a diffrenet menue to when if you log in as admin which has some extra value on jobs that it can do and finally you 
create the task and print it to the task.txt file
